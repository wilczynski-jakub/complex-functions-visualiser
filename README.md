# Complex Functions Visualiser
A program written in Java to visualise complex functions, using custom graphic images. 

## The idea behind
Let $z$ be a complex number, such that:
$$z = x + iy$$
and let $f$ be any complex function:
$$f: \mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$$
<br>
Then, let $f(z)$ be denoted by $z'$, whereas:
$$z' = x' + iy'$$
